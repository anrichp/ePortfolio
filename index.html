        <p>
          This module provides a high-level introduction/overview of the topics
          covered in greater detail in other modules in the Master's programme,
          as well as aspects you will encounter during your career in Computer
          Science. You may find it useful to refer to the module contents
          regularly throughout your course.

        <h2>Object-oriented Information Systems</h2>
        <p>
          The module examines the different elements of an information system
          from design through to processing and storage. You will explore the
          fundamental concepts behind object-oriented development using UML as a
          tool for analysis and design. Further to this, we will make use of
          Python to provide concrete experience of object-oriented development.

        <h2>Network and Information Security Management</h2>
        <p>
          This module will give you a grounding in security concepts and
          terminology, illustrated by hands on practice in one of the most
          important aspects of information security today â€“ network technology.
          We do not assume any prior knowledge of either topic, so we will start
          at the grass roots level, providing knowledge in the basics of both
          information security and network technology. We will use the latter to
          illustrate some very important security concepts such as vulnerability
          assessments, penetration testing, forensic analysis and breach
          management. We will conclude the module with a look at some of the
          challenges that face the Internet as we know it today, and
          consideration of how recent and emerging network technology can be
          used to mitigate some of the issues presented.
