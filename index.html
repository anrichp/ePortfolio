        <p>
          This module provides a high-level introduction/overview of the topics
          covered in greater detail in other modules in the Master's programme,
          as well as aspects you will encounter during your career in Computer
          Science. You may find it useful to refer to the module contents
          regularly throughout your course.

        <h2>Object-oriented Information Systems</h2>
        <p>
          The module examines the different elements of an information system
          from design through to processing and storage. You will explore the
          fundamental concepts behind object-oriented development using UML as a
          tool for analysis and design. Further to this, we will make use of
          Python to provide concrete experience of object-oriented development.

        <h2>Network and Information Security Management</h2>
        <p>
          This module will give you a grounding in security concepts and
          terminology, illustrated by hands on practice in one of the most
          important aspects of information security today – network technology.
          We do not assume any prior knowledge of either topic, so we will start
          at the grass roots level, providing knowledge in the basics of both
          information security and network technology. We will use the latter to
          illustrate some very important security concepts such as vulnerability
          assessments, penetration testing, forensic analysis and breach
          management. We will conclude the module with a look at some of the
          challenges that face the Internet as we know it today, and
          consideration of how recent and emerging network technology can be
          used to mitigate some of the issues presented.

        <h2>Secure Software Development</h2>
        <p>
          This module will take an in depth look at the security risks that are
          associated with programming languages, from the perspectives of design
          and architecture approaches, programming paradigms, testing, the
          impact and implications of operating systems and libraries on software
          development, the security risks associated with distributed systems
          and APIs, and future trends in secure software and systems design.
          Running through these topics will be the concept of the secure
          software development life cycle.

          This module aims to provide you with a practical foundation in
          research methods that will enable you to conduct research in a
          practical setting. The module covers various tools and techniques that
          you, as a researcher, may need and allows for feedback throughout the
          module through cases and project tasks.  The module also provides
          essential insight into the legal, social, ethical and
          professional issues applicable to computing projects, as well as the
          relevant codes of practice and practices.

        <p>
          In this module, you will be exposed to what it means to be a Project
          Manager of a software engineering project. We will examine the
          relationships between the Project Manager and the other stakeholders
          in a project, and the role that the Project Manager has in ensuring
          that the triple constraints of project management are balanced, and
