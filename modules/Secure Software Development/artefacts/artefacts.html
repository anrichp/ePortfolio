          Choose an open-source UML tool from the list above. Select one of the
          coding weaknesses which have been identified by OWASP and create a
          flowchart of the steps which may have led to the weakness occurring.

          Read Larson (2018) and Weidman (n.d.) then answer the questions below,
          adding them as evidence to your e-portfolio. You may want to complete
          this activity in conjunction with or after completing Seminar 2

            What are the common problems associated with the use of regex? How
            can these be mitigated?

          <li>
            How and why could regex be used as part of a security solution?

        <h3>Recursion</h3>
        <p>
          One of the classic programming problems that is often solved by
          recursion is the towers of Hanoi problem. A good explanation and
          walkthrough are provided by Cormen & Balkcom (n.d.) - the link is in
          the reading list. (the code they used for their visual example is
          provided on their website as well).
        </p>
        <h3>Regex</h3>
        <p>
          The second language concept we will look at is regular expressions
          (regex). We have already presented some studies on their use, and
          potential problems, above. The lecturecast also contains a useful link
          to a tutorial on creating regex.

        <h3>Brief</h3>
        <p>
          You are required to develop an application for an organisation with
          domain-specific requirements. A domain refers to a group of users with
          similar application and hardware requirements.

          Select one or more of the tools installed above and use it/them to test
          the code your team has created as part of the summative assessment.
          You should demonstrate your tests (and share your results) during the
          Seminar. Discuss the need to change the code based on the output from
          the test tools/linters.
