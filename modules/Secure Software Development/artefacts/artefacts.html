        <h3>Recursion</h3>
        <p>
          One of the classic programming problems that is often solved by
          recursion is the towers of Hanoi problem. A good explanation and
          walkthrough are provided by Cormen & Balkcom (n.d.) - the link is in
          the reading list. (the code they used for their visual example is
          provided on their website as well).
        </p>
        <h3>Regex</h3>
        <p>
          The second language concept we will look at is regular expressions
          (regex). We have already presented some studies on their use, and
          potential problems, above. The lecturecast also contains a useful link
          to a tutorial on creating regex.

          You are required to develop an application for an organisation with
          domain-specific requirements. A domain refers to a group of users with
          similar application and hardware requirements.

        <h2>Collaborative Discussion 2: Cryptography case study: TrueCrypt</h2>
        <h3>Discussion Topic</h3>
        <p>
          TrueCrypt was a popular and well-respected operating system add-on
          that could create encrypted volumes on a Windows and/or Linux system.
          In addition, it was also designed to create a complete, bootable
          volume that could encrypt the entire operating system and data for a
          Windows XP system. It was discontinued in 2014.
