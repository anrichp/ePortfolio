          Review the essay requirements in unit 12. Prepare a 500-word proposal
          which outlines the contents of the final/summative module essay,
          reflecting current developments in computing. Your proposal outline
          should contain:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>A working title of the project.</li>
          <li>
            A brief outline of the organisation and problem you wish to explore.
          </li>
          <li>
            A discussion of the issues that you wish to investigate for the
            organisation, i.e., the current situation, what you wish to propose,
            problems, rationale for the selection of technology, and so on.

        <h3>Feedback</h3>
        <p>
          You have selected an excellent topic and used an example that is
          pragmatic and timely. You used a good set of literature. I think you
          can mention what session and tract you are interested in. You may
          provide a brief introduction and then gradually build up arguments to
          answer the below questions:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Office, process and document automations have changed the business
            atmosphere in terms of operations and co-operations. Evaluate, with
            examples, how your chosen organisation has adapted the technology
            that has facilitated the changes in working practices and habits,
            productivity and management efficiencies.
          </li>
          <li>
            Critically discuss and evaluate the benefits and drawbacks of
            implementing such technology in the organisation.
          </li>
          <li>
            Competitive advantage is one of the benefits businesses strive to
            achieve in the application and use of information systems.
            Critically analyse with the aid of diagrams, models and/or
            frameworks, how the organisation can achieve efficiency by
            implementing the technology that you are proposing.
          </li>
          <li>
            Outline the threats, security and other challenges that your
            proposed technology can impose on the organisation. What
            recommendations do you have to protect this organisation from these
            threats?
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          I would advise you to expand the case with a solid example so you can
          discuss success and failure stories and can relate to the above
          questions.
