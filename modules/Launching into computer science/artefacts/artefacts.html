          Review the essay requirements in unit 12. Prepare a 500-word proposal
          which outlines the contents of the final/summative module essay,
          reflecting current developments in computing. Your proposal outline
          should contain:

        <ul>
          <li>A working title of the project.</li>
          <li>
            A brief outline of the organisation and problem you wish to explore.

          <li>
            A discussion of the issues that you wish to investigate for the

        <p>
          You have selected an excellent topic and used an example that is
          pragmatic and timely. You used a good set of literature. I think you
          can mention what session and tract you are interested in. You may
          provide a brief introduction and then gradually build up arguments to
          answer the below questions:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Office, process and document automations have changed the business
            atmosphere in terms of operations and co-operations. Evaluate, with
            examples, how your chosen organisation has adapted the technology
            that has facilitated the changes in working practices and habits,
            productivity and management efficiencies.
          </li>
          <li>
            Critically discuss and evaluate the benefits and drawbacks of
            implementing such technology in the organisation.
          </li>
          <li>
            Competitive advantage is one of the benefits businesses strive to
            achieve in the application and use of information systems.
            Critically analyse with the aid of diagrams, models and/or
            frameworks, how the organisation can achieve efficiency by
            implementing the technology that you are proposing.
          </li>
          <li>
            Outline the threats, security and other challenges that your
            proposed technology can impose on the organisation. What
            recommendations do you have to protect this organisation from these
            threats?
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          I would advise you to expand the case with a solid example so you can
          discuss success and failure stories and can relate to the above
          questions.

        <p>
          This assignment is a Data Structure challenge to assess your skills on
          defining basic data structure and its operation. Complete the
          following 4 questions.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Question 1: Suppose you are doing a sequential search of the list
            [15, 18, 2, 19, 18, 0, 8, 14, 19, 14]. How many comparisons would
            you need to do in order to find the key 18? Show the steps.
          </li>
          <li>
            Question 2: Suppose you have following list of numbers to sort [19,
            1, 9, 7, 3, 10, 13, 15, 8, 12]. Show the partially sorted list after
            three complete phases of bubble sort.
          </li>
          <li>Question 3: Given the statement below</li>
          <p>
            x = BinaryTree('a') <br />
            insert_left(x,'b') <br />
            insert_right(x,'c') insert_right(get_right_child(x),'d') <br />
            insert_left(get_right_child(get_right_child(x)),'e')
          </p>
          <p>
            Which of these answers is the correct representation of the tree?
            Show your working out.

                Very good work. You showed all the steps using diagram and
                pseudocode. Flode decision flow diagram is an excellent step to
                demonstrate your algorithm.

                Great work. Steps are shown using diagram and pseudocode. Using
                code is a good idea to demonstrate how you have implemented the
                data structure.

                Answer is correct. Brilliant work as you demonstrated the tree
                and used phython code to show how you selected the right answer

                Fantastic work. You showed the steps for each question and used
