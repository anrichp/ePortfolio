        <p>
          You have selected an excellent topic and used an example that is
          pragmatic and timely. You used a good set of literature. I think you
          can mention what session and tract you are interested in. You may
          provide a brief introduction and then gradually build up arguments to
          answer the below questions:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Office, process and document automations have changed the business
            atmosphere in terms of operations and co-operations. Evaluate, with
            examples, how your chosen organisation has adapted the technology
            that has facilitated the changes in working practices and habits,
            productivity and management efficiencies.
          </li>
          <li>
            Critically discuss and evaluate the benefits and drawbacks of
            implementing such technology in the organisation.
          </li>
          <li>
            Competitive advantage is one of the benefits businesses strive to
            achieve in the application and use of information systems.
            Critically analyse with the aid of diagrams, models and/or
            frameworks, how the organisation can achieve efficiency by
            implementing the technology that you are proposing.
          </li>
          <li>
            Outline the threats, security and other challenges that your
            proposed technology can impose on the organisation. What
            recommendations do you have to protect this organisation from these
            threats?
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          I would advise you to expand the case with a solid example so you can
          discuss success and failure stories and can relate to the above
          questions.

            you need to do in order to find the key 18? Show the steps.
          </li>
          <li>

        <p>Python programming exercise:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Code a function called 'first_div_16' ACCEPT two positive integers,
            n1 and n2, as inputs RETURN the first number in range(n1,n2) that is
            divisible by 16. HOWEVER, if no number in the range is divisible by
            16 RETURN 0.
          </li>
          <li>
            Code a function called 'halve_to_2' ACCEPT one numeric input. If the
            number <= 0, RETURN -1. If the number > 0, divide that integer
            over-and-over by 2 until it becomes smaller than 2. RETURN that
            smaller-than-2 number, e.g. input of 4 Will yield 1 (4->2->1), 5
            yields 1.25 (5->2.5->1.25) etc.
          </li>
          <li>
            Code a function called 'string_expansion'. ACCEPT a non-empty string
            as input RETURN a string that contains every other character, 2n+2
            times, where n is the original index of the letter. e.g. Input of
            "Hello" should result in "HHlllllloooooooooo". Input of "ROBErt"
            should result in "RRBBBBBBrrrrrrrrrr".
          </li>
          <li>
            Code a function called 'item_count_from_index'. ACCEPT two inputs, a
            list and an integer-index RETURN a count (number) of how many times
            the item at that index appears in the list. HOWEVER, if the
            integer-index is out of bounds for the list RETURN the empty string
            ("") (e.g. list of 3 items, index of 5 is out of bounds).
          </li>
          <li>
            Code a function called 'length_times_largest'. ACCEPT a list as
            input RETURN the length of the list times the largest integer (not
            float) in the list. HOWEVER, if the list does not contain an
            integer, RETURN the empty string ("").
