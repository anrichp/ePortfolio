        <h3>Discussion Topic</h3>
        <p>
          Human emotions can affect the user experience, a fact which
          contributes to the complexity of user satisfaction with a product.
          Further complicating the process is the fact that user emotions on the
          first use of a product are likely to be different to their emotions
          once they become more experienced.
        </p>
        <ul>

            Read Minge & Thuring (2018). Based on the change in human emotion
            over time, might you adapt Figure 1 in their paper in any way?

        <h2>Development Team Project: Project Report</h2>
        <h3>Discussion Topic</h3>
        <p>
          You are tasked with supporting the end-to-end life cycle of developing
          the software that can be used in a child's toy. In this role, you will
          be required to collect the requirements of the customer requesting
          that the toy is produced, executing the development of the software
          that will be used in the toy, and delivering the software product to
          the customer. The customer should have ability to interact with the
          toy through an interface, and the capabilities of the programmable
          element of the toy should be supported using data structures and an
          algorithm. The development produced may not accommodate all of the
          customer's requirements; interactions will take place with the
          customer at various stages throughout the SDLC.

        <h2>Development Team Project: Presentation</h2>
        <p>
          Carrying on from the Full Brief provided in Unit 6, this assignment
          focuses on the second deliverable, a presentation of your design from
          Unit 6. This submission should consist of a presentation to the major
          stakeholders that consists of a status/ progress update, a
          demonstration of the demo model/simulation, and a plan and budget
          showing how the product will progress from design through
          implementation and ultimately UAT.
