        <h3>Case Study</h3>
        <p>
          Ricardo works for the records department of his local government as a
          computer records clerk, where he has access to files of property tax
          records. For a scientific study, a researcher, Beth, has been granted
          access to the numerical portion “but not the corresponding names” of
          some records.
        </p>
        <p>
          Beth finds some information that she would like to use, but she needs
          the names and addresses corresponding with certain properties. Beth
          asks Ricardo to retrieve these names and addresses, so she can contact
          these people for more information and for permission to do further
          study.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now consider, what are the ethical issues involved in deciding which
          of these options to pursue?
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            If Ricardo is not responsible for determining allowable access,
            should he release the names and addresses?
          </li>
          <li>
            Suppose Ricardo were responsible for determining allowable access to
            the files. What ethical issues would be involved in his deciding
            whether to grant access to Beth?
          </li>
          <li>
            Should Beth be allowed to contact the individuals involved? That is,
            should the Records department release individuals' names to a
            researcher? What are the ethical issues for the Records department
            to consider?
          </li>
          <li>
            Suppose Beth contacts the individuals to ask their permission, and
            one-third of them respond giving permission, one-third respond
            denying permission, and one-third do not respond. Beth claims that
            at least one-half of the individuals are needed to make a valid
            study. What options are available to Beth?
          </li>
        </ul>
