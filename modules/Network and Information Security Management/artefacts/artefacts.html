        <h2>Collaborative Learning Discussion 1</h2>
        <h3>Discussion Topic</h3>
        <p>
          Read Glisson, W., Andel, T., McDonald, T., Jacobs, M., Campbell, M. &
          Mayr, J. (2015) Compromising a Medical Mannequin. Healthcare
          Information Systems and Technology (Sighealth).
        </p>
        <p>Answer the following discussion questions:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            What are the major threats and vulnerabilities discussed in the
            paper?
          </li>
          <li>How would you mitigate against these?</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          You should demonstrate that you understand the topic covered and
          ensure you use references to academic literature (including journals,
          books, and reports). This activity will provide evidence of your
          personal growth and your summary post is required in your e-portfolio.
        </p>
        <h4>Learning Outcome</h4>
        <p>
          Gather and synthesise information from multiple sources (including
          Internet security alerts and warning sites) to aid in the systematic
          analysis of security breaches and issues

        <p>
          The group contract will help set expectations and necessary guidelines
          for the group project. These expectations cover preparations for and
          attendance of meetings, individual behaviours, and communication.

        <h3>STRIDE and DREAD tools</h3>
        <p>
          During this seminar, we will use the Microsoft STRIDE & DREAD tools
          (discussed in the lecturecast and in Meier, J., Mackman, A., Dunner,
          M., Vasireddy, S., Escamilla, R. and Murukan, A. (2003). Threat
          Modelling.).
        </p>
        <p>
          Read the paper and review the lecturecast, and then based on your
          response in Collaborative Learning Discussion 1, answer the questions
          below:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Use a 3 level DREAD rating where 0 = no risk and 3 = maximum risk.
          </li>
          <li>
            Which is the risk with the highest rating? What assumptions have you
            made?
          </li>
        </ul>
