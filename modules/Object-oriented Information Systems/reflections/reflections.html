        <h2>Unit 1 Reflection</h2>
        <p>
          Unit 1 was an excellent introduction to information systems;
          admittedly, I thought I understood what an information system was.
          Still, after researching an information system failure, I realised
          that I was lead astray by my definition of an information system.
        </p>
        <p>
          Later I discovered that information systems are made up of five
          components hardware, software, data people, and process. Organisations
          often use these systems to collect, filter, process, create and
          distribute data.
        </p>
        <p>
          An example of an information system could be Walmart’s retail
          management system which keeps track stock levels within the
          organisation and allows vendors and suppliers to access these stock
          levels to assign stock where necessary dynamically.
        </p>
        <p>
          After understanding what information system is, we were tasked to
          participate in a discussion form that outlined an organisation and an
          information system failure. Unfortunately, I misunderstood what
          information systems were and used a medical treatment device
          controlled by a computer system as an example of an information system
          failure. The medical machine or device contains some of the five
          components of an information system; however, it does not help an
          organisation manage its resources and distribute information and data.
        </p>
        <p>
          Going into Unit 2, I have a greater awareness of what an information
          system is, and this should allow me to better respond to my peers in
          the follow-up questions in the discussion forum.

        <h2>Unit 2 Reflection</h2>
        <p>
          Unit 2 formed mostly a continuation of the discussion forum in Unit 1,
          where we further explored information systems’ failures in different
          contexts. Fascinatingly some of the largest organisations with ample
          resources are the ones who are failing miserably at producing
          information systems which meet the initial criteria.
        </p>
        <p>
          This week, it has become clear that the organisations failed in
          crucial aspects of the development life cycle in most information
          system failures. In the two cases that I had explored in the
          discussion forums, it was clear that the failures resulted from
          insufficient planning, insufficient testing and a failure to analyse
          the organisation and its business needs to understand better how the
          IT assets co-exist with the organisation.
        </p>
        <p>
          The more I read about these failures, the more I see the lack of
          processes and planning combined with politics and leaders’ opinions
          within the organisation that ultimately skew the information system’s
          outcome and success. We require a stringent system and process to be
          in place and good sign-off from organisations to prevent the system
          from wandering down a path of failure.

        <h2>Unit 3 Reflection</h2>
        <p>
          Throughout this unit, I have gained some fundamental knowledge of
          object orientated programming using Python.
        </p>
        <p>
          Object orientated programming is incredibly powerful as you can
          segment components within a system which allows you to work on a
          specific component without the fear of crippling an entire system.
        </p>
        <p>
          I particularly find the Python __init__ method quite fascinating, the
          method allows you to pre-append a template of sorts to your program
          allowing the data structure of the class to be defined before you
          continue building the methods within that class. When creating a
          method within a class one has to be careful to include the “self”
          attribute which is incredibly important as the method is then able to
          access the state and variables of the class.
        </p>
        <p>
          Looking forward to Unit 4, I am quite excited to work with more
          complex objects and understand inheritance and the role it plays in
          polymorphism.
