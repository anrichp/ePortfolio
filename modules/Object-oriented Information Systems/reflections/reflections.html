        <h2>Unit 1 Reflection</h2>
        <p>
          Unit 1 was an excellent introduction to information systems;
          admittedly, I thought I understood what an information system was.
          Still, after researching an information system failure, I realised
          that I was lead astray by my definition of an information system.
        </p>
        <p>
          Later I discovered that information systems are made up of five
          components hardware, software, data people, and process. Organisations
          often use these systems to collect, filter, process, create and
          distribute data.
        </p>
        <p>
          An example of an information system could be Walmart’s retail
          management system which keeps track stock levels within the
          organisation and allows vendors and suppliers to access these stock
          levels to assign stock where necessary dynamically.
        </p>
        <p>
          After understanding what information system is, we were tasked to
          participate in a discussion form that outlined an organisation and an
          information system failure. Unfortunately, I misunderstood what
          information systems were and used a medical treatment device
          controlled by a computer system as an example of an information system
          failure. The medical machine or device contains some of the five
          components of an information system; however, it does not help an
          organisation manage its resources and distribute information and data.
        </p>
        <p>
          Going into Unit 2, I have a greater awareness of what an information
          system is, and this should allow me to better respond to my peers in
          the follow-up questions in the discussion forum.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section id="reflections">
        <h2>Unit 2 Reflection</h2>
        <p>
          Unit 2 formed mostly a continuation of the discussion forum in Unit 1,
          where we further explored information systems’ failures in different
          contexts. Fascinatingly some of the largest organisations with ample
          resources are the ones who are failing miserably at producing
          information systems which meet the initial criteria.
        </p>
        <p>
          This week, it has become clear that the organisations failed in
          crucial aspects of the development life cycle in most information
          system failures. In the two cases that I had explored in the
          discussion forums, it was clear that the failures resulted from
          insufficient planning, insufficient testing and a failure to analyse
          the organisation and its business needs to understand better how the
          IT assets co-exist with the organisation.
        </p>
        <p>
          The more I read about these failures, the more I see the lack of
          processes and planning combined with politics and leaders’ opinions
          within the organisation that ultimately skew the information system’s
          outcome and success. We require a stringent system and process to be
          in place and good sign-off from organisations to prevent the system
          from wandering down a path of failure.

        <h2>Unit 3 Reflection</h2>
        <p>
          Throughout this unit, I have gained some fundamental knowledge of
          object orientated programming using Python.
        </p>
        <p>
          Object orientated programming is incredibly powerful as you can
          segment components within a system which allows you to work on a
          specific component without the fear of crippling an entire system.
        </p>
        <p>
          I particularly find the Python __init__ method quite fascinating, the
          method allows you to pre-append a template of sorts to your program
          allowing the data structure of the class to be defined before you
          continue building the methods within that class. When creating a
          method within a class one has to be careful to include the “self”
          attribute which is incredibly important as the method is then able to
          access the state and variables of the class.
        </p>
        <p>
          Looking forward to Unit 4, I am quite excited to work with more
          complex objects and understand inheritance and the role it plays in
          polymorphism.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section id="reflections">
        <h2>Unit 4 Reflection</h2>
        <p>
          Unit 4’s primary outcomes were to establish a greater understanding of
          objects, classes, class functions, class methods and inheritance.
        </p>
        <p>
          I found Unit 4 quite overwhelming as I found the sheer volume of
          programming to be quite disorientating. I find that I have understood
          the most basic concepts of the desired outcomes however I find that
          certain concepts regarding inheritance are beyond my understanding at
          this point.
        </p>
        <p>
          Having previously created an information system in Flask I feel
          confident that I should be able to execute the practical element of
          this module regardless of my limited understanding of the material.
        </p>
        <p>
          Looking forward I will need to spend more time practising inheritance
          and better understand the use of classes and the decisions as to when
          to create classes to divide up individual components.

        <h2>Unit 5 Reflection</h2>
        <p>
          In Unit 5, I was introduced to UML for the first time. The purpose of
          Unit 5 was to extend the object-orientated design understanding from
          the previous Units in a way that allows us to design a piece of
          software visually and communicate this in a way that other programmers
          or software developers would understand.
        </p>
        <p>
          I can see that UML is an integral part of the software engineering
          process. I found it quite challenging to decide how to layout the UML
          diagrams and which methods to use in which classes. Additionally, I
          discovered that I would need to spend more time practicing programming
          in Python. Some of the concepts continue to illude me and result in
          some confusion during the design process.
        </p>
        <p>
          I learned about the importance of UML, and I feel I now better
          understand some of the critical elements of a UML diagram. Going into
          Unit 6, I will need to spend some time practicing Python to better
          understand OOS.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section id="reflections">
        <h2>Unit 6 Reflection</h2>
        <p>
          During Week 6, I have continued to learn more about the UML language
          and spent more time better understanding object-orientated programming
          using Python. Concepts that I am unfamiliar with are composition and
          aggregation, to name a few, and I need to continue working on my
          understanding of these relationships in UML diagrams.
        </p>
        <p>
          I feel I have learned how to use UML effectively but require more time
          to practice the coming week to feel comfortable with the mid module
          assignment requirements. I continue to feel concerned that my lack of
          programming proficiency ultimately hinders my ability to design the
          assignment’s system at the end of Week 7.
        </p>
        <p>
          Looking forward to Week 7, I will need to spend more time practising
          object-orientated programming and begin to work on my mid-module
          assignment using the understanding I have acquired over the last few
          weeks.

        <h2>Unit 7 Reflection</h2>
        <p>
          During Unit 7 we started the week off with the fundamentals of
          database design and ended the week with a task on normalisation. I
          found this week rather chaotic as the deadline for the mid module
          assignment was at the end of Unit 7. I had to decide whether to work
          on my assignment or whether to spend time reading through the material
          for the week, I chose the former. However, I did find time to work
          through the reading which led up to the task on normalisation for Unit
          8s’s seminar.
        </p>
        <p>
          I found the reading in Unit 7 about functional dependencies incredibly
          difficult to understand, the mathematics was quite intense and I
          struggled to make sense of what I was reading. As an extension, the
          practice of normalisation was affected as a result of my difficulty
          understanding functional dependencies. I found the seminar in Unit 8
          quite encouraging as it seemed that most students were grappling with
          the complexities of normalisation. Ultimately database design is an
          art form and one has to take time to practice and develop the skills
          required to normalise databases effectively.
        </p>
        <p>
          Going into Unit 8, I will be taking the time to watch Jenny’s
          Lecturers on DBMS to gain a greater understanding of databases and the
          process of normalisation. Secondly, I will need to spend time on my
          system implementation assignment which is due on the 12th of April.
        </p>

      <section id="reflections">
        <h2>Unit 8 Reflection</h2>
        <p>
          During Unit 8, I extended my understanding of database design, using
          knowledge obtained about functional dependencies and normalisation.
          Additionally, I learned how to draw an entity-relationship diagram in
          lucidchart and use the MySQL workbench tool to draw an EER diagram
          that is an extension of a traditional ER diagram but shares many
          similarities with an ERD diagram.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have gained a greater understanding of functional dependencies and
          normalisation. Still, I require a fair amount of knowledge to
          completely understand how to apply fundamental dependencies and
          normalisation in my database design practice.
        </p>
        <p>
          Looking forward, I will need to continue exploring RDBMS systems and
          fully understand the concepts of the relationships and dependencies. I
          have discovered an existing YouTube playlist that I am currently
          working through to gain a greater understanding.

        <h2>Unit 9 Reflection</h2>
        <p>
          During Unit 9, we were introduced to the concepts of CRUD (Create,
          Read, Update and Delete) in MySQL databases, the codio exercises
          regarding MySQL was a great resource to understand the various queries
          used in CRUD. Additionally, we learned about NoSQL and the benefits of
          these databases, along with their best use cases.
        </p>
        <p>
          This unit has made me reflect on the system implementation assignment
          and store the assignment’s data. After doing some research, I have
          come across ORM(Object Relational Mapping). ORM can be used to map
          classes to a database in a relational way. I have decided to use
          SQLAlchemy, which is an ORM for MySQL and Python.
        </p>
        <p>
          Looking forward to Unit 10, I will start on my system implementation
          and work on mapping my classes to tables within the database.
          Additionally, I will need to do some additional reading on style
          guidelines for comments in my implementation.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section id="reflections">
        <h2>Unit 10 Reflection</h2>
        <p>
          During Unit 10, I began working on the Mid Module Assignment, the
          System Implementation project and continued contributing to the
          Discussion Forum titled Alternatives to SQL.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am reflecting on some of the decisions I made during the design of
          my system implementation project. I have found many shortcomings in my
          design. I will likely need to deviate from the design to achieve a
          working solution for the assignment. From prior experience using
          SQLAlchemy, an ORM (Object Relational Mapper), I have decided to use
          SQLAlchemy for my system implementation. It should allow me to
          maintain my system design's object-oriented structure and map those
          classes to tables within the database. I have begun mapping the
          classes indicated in my system design to tables within a SQL database;
          for the interim, I will use Sqlite3 for testing.
        </p>
        <p>
          Additional to my system implementation project, I have continued
          contributing to the Alternatives to SQL discussion forum, which I have
          thoroughly enjoyed. After researching a few alternatives, I am pretty
          excited by MongoDB as an alternative to traditional SQL databases, and
          I am, in retrospect, quite annoyed that I had not learned of MongoDB
          sooner. I believe using a NoSQL database would have been an exciting
          challenge for the system implementation project.
        </p>
        <p>
          Looking forward to Unit 11, I will continue to work towards my system
          implementation project, which is due at the end of Unit 11. I will
          ensure that my classes in my code map correctly to my database, which
          will lay a good foundation for the code to follow.
