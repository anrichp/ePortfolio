        <h2>Unit 1 Reflection</h2>
        <p>
          Unit 1 was an excellent introduction to information systems;
          admittedly, I thought I understood what an information system was.
          Still, after researching an information system failure, I realised
          that I was lead astray by my definition of an information system.
        </p>
        <p>
          Later I discovered that information systems are made up of five
          components hardware, software, data people, and process. Organisations
          often use these systems to collect, filter, process, create and
          distribute data.
        </p>
        <p>
          An example of an information system could be Walmart’s retail
          management system which keeps track stock levels within the
          organisation and allows vendors and suppliers to access these stock
          levels to assign stock where necessary dynamically.
        </p>
        <p>
          After understanding what information system is, we were tasked to
          participate in a discussion form that outlined an organisation and an
          information system failure. Unfortunately, I misunderstood what
          information systems were and used a medical treatment device
          controlled by a computer system as an example of an information system
          failure. The medical machine or device contains some of the five
          components of an information system; however, it does not help an
          organisation manage its resources and distribute information and data.
        </p>
        <p>
          Going into Unit 2, I have a greater awareness of what an information
          system is, and this should allow me to better respond to my peers in
          the follow-up questions in the discussion forum.
        </p>

        <h2>Unit 2 Reflection</h2>
        <p>
          Unit 2 formed mostly a continuation of the discussion forum in Unit 1,
          where we further explored information systems’ failures in different
          contexts. Fascinatingly some of the largest organisations with ample
          resources are the ones who are failing miserably at producing
          information systems which meet the initial criteria.
        </p>
        <p>
          This week, it has become clear that the organisations failed in
          crucial aspects of the development life cycle in most information
          system failures. In the two cases that I had explored in the
          discussion forums, it was clear that the failures resulted from
          insufficient planning, insufficient testing and a failure to analyse
          the organisation and its business needs to understand better how the
          IT assets co-exist with the organisation.
        </p>
        <p>
          The more I read about these failures, the more I see the lack of
          processes and planning combined with politics and leaders’ opinions
          within the organisation that ultimately skew the information system’s
          outcome and success. We require a stringent system and process to be
          in place and good sign-off from organisations to prevent the system
          from wandering down a path of failure.

        <h2>Unit 3 Reflection</h2>
        <p>
          Throughout this unit, I have gained some fundamental knowledge of
          object orientated programming using Python.
        </p>
        <p>
          Object orientated programming is incredibly powerful as you can
          segment components within a system which allows you to work on a
          specific component without the fear of crippling an entire system.
        </p>
        <p>
          I particularly find the Python __init__ method quite fascinating, the
          method allows you to pre-append a template of sorts to your program
          allowing the data structure of the class to be defined before you
          continue building the methods within that class. When creating a
          method within a class one has to be careful to include the “self”
          attribute which is incredibly important as the method is then able to
          access the state and variables of the class.
        </p>
        <p>
          Looking forward to Unit 4, I am quite excited to work with more
          complex objects and understand inheritance and the role it plays in
          polymorphism.
        </p>

        <h2>Unit 4 Reflection</h2>
        <p>
          Unit 4’s primary outcomes were to establish a greater understanding of
          objects, classes, class functions, class methods and inheritance.
        </p>
        <p>
          I found Unit 4 quite overwhelming as I found the sheer volume of
          programming to be quite disorientating. I find that I have understood
          the most basic concepts of the desired outcomes however I find that
          certain concepts regarding inheritance are beyond my understanding at
          this point.
        </p>
        <p>
          Having previously created an information system in Flask I feel
          confident that I should be able to execute the practical element of
          this module regardless of my limited understanding of the material.
        </p>
        <p>
          Looking forward I will need to spend more time practising inheritance
          and better understand the use of classes and the decisions as to when
          to create classes to divide up individual components.

        <h2>Unit 5 Reflection</h2>
        <p>
          In Unit 5, I was introduced to UML for the first time. The purpose of
          Unit 5 was to extend the object-orientated design understanding from
          the previous Units in a way that allows us to design a piece of
          software visually and communicate this in a way that other programmers
          or software developers would understand.
        </p>
        <p>
          I can see that UML is an integral part of the software engineering
          process. I found it quite challenging to decide how to layout the UML
          diagrams and which methods to use in which classes. Additionally, I
          discovered that I would need to spend more time practicing programming
          in Python. Some of the concepts continue to illude me and result in
          some confusion during the design process.
        </p>
        <p>
          I learned about the importance of UML, and I feel I now better
          understand some of the critical elements of a UML diagram. Going into
          Unit 6, I will need to spend some time practicing Python to better
          understand OOS.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section id="reflections">
        <h2>Unit 6 Reflection</h2>
        <p>
          During Week 6, I have continued to learn more about the UML language
          and spent more time better understanding object-orientated programming
          using Python. Concepts that I am unfamiliar with are composition and
          aggregation, to name a few, and I need to continue working on my
          understanding of these relationships in UML diagrams.
        </p>
        <p>
          I feel I have learned how to use UML effectively but require more time
          to practice the coming week to feel comfortable with the mid module
          assignment requirements. I continue to feel concerned that my lack of
          programming proficiency ultimately hinders my ability to design the
          assignment’s system at the end of Week 7.
        </p>
        <p>
          Looking forward to Week 7, I will need to spend more time practising
          object-orientated programming and begin to work on my mid-module
          assignment using the understanding I have acquired over the last few
          weeks.
