        <h2>Unit 1 Reflection</h2>
        <p>
          Unit 1 was an excellent introduction to information systems;
          admittedly, I thought I understood what an information system was.
          Still, after researching an information system failure, I realised
          that I was lead astray by my definition of an information system.
        </p>
        <p>
          Later I discovered that information systems are made up of five
          components hardware, software, data people, and process. Organisations
          often use these systems to collect, filter, process, create and
          distribute data.
        </p>
        <p>
          An example of an information system could be Walmartâ€™s retail
          management system which keeps track stock levels within the
          organisation and allows vendors and suppliers to access these stock
          levels to assign stock where necessary dynamically.
        </p>
        <p>
          After understanding what information system is, we were tasked to
          participate in a discussion form that outlined an organisation and an
          information system failure. Unfortunately, I misunderstood what
          information systems were and used a medical treatment device
          controlled by a computer system as an example of an information system
          failure. The medical machine or device contains some of the five
          components of an information system; however, it does not help an
          organisation manage its resources and distribute information and data.
        </p>
        <p>
          Going into Unit 2, I have a greater awareness of what an information
          system is, and this should allow me to better respond to my peers in
          the follow-up questions in the discussion forum.
