        <p>Very good stuff. Clear and accurate.</p>
        <h4>Alice Villar</h4>
        <p>Hi Anrich,</p>
        <p>
          Your syntax inside the classes (attributes and actions) looks perfect.
          You always start with lowercase letters and then indicate the data
          type. I could understand the content of every class.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, the relationships between the classes look confusing.
          Following Yohay, I used StarUML, which helped a lot because the arrow
          comes with the correspondent name (composition, aggregation,
          generalization, etc. ) I believe that once you use the UML arrows it
          will look more clear.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also think you missed the payment class, which I believe would help
          a lot to organize the flow. For instance, in my diagram, I created a
          relationship of composition between payment and loyalty schemes,
          meaning that customers with loyalty will have discounts in payments.
          When there is no composition, we have that awkward situation where we
          receive a discount but it is not automatically applied to the payment.
          It has happened to me. The design has to be clear so the programming
          does not lead to situations like this.
        </p>

        <h2>Seminar 3: Working with UML</h2>
        <p>
          In this week’s activity, you are going to get some hands-on practice
          with UML, with a scenario, which is described below. You have been
          asked to develop UML diagrams for a doctor’s surgery based on the
          following scenario:
        </p>
        <p>
          Before a patient can see a doctor, or nurse, they will be required to
          make an appointment. The appointment will be made by the receptionist.
          However, before making the appointment, the receptionist needs to ask
          the patient which doctor they would like to see, and whether the
          appointment is standard consultation or an emergency appointment. The
          receptionist will use this information to check the appointment
          schedule, find an available appointment and make the booking. During
          the appointment itself, the doctor may issue the patient with a
          prescription. It is possible for a patient to request a repeat
          prescription be raised. Receptionists are able to cancel appointments
          as well as create them. A doctor at the clinic may have a maximum of
          500 patients registered to them at any one time.
        </p>
        <p>You should create:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>A class diagram for the system.</li>
          <li>A sequence diagram for booking an appointment.</li>
          <li>
            An activity diagram for a receptionist booking an appointment.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Alice Villar</h4>
        <p>Hi Anrich,</p>
        <p>I think your diagram is great!! Thank you for sharing.</p>
        <p>
          My only observation is about having 2 tables for owners and clients.
          Personally, I'd rather create a table for People than two tables for
          owner and client. After all the goal is to organize data to prevent
          redundancy.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another observation I have is that when I first saw your diagram I
          asked myself : "why didn't he create keys to his relationship tables
          ("issueJunction" and "propertyJunction")?". Then, when I created my
          own diagram I realized that for some reason it just doesn't show in
          the automatic diagram. In my code, I defined a composite key to those
          tables and created foreign keys. I think we did the same thing in the
          code:
        </p>
        <code>
          CREATE TABLE Property_Person ( Property_Id int not null, Person_Id int
          not null, primary key (Property_Id,Person_Id), foreign key
          (Property_Id) references Property (Property_Cod), foreign key
          (Person_Id) references Person (Person_Cod) );

        <h2>Mid-Module Assignment: System Design</h2>
        <h3>Assignment topic: System Design</h3>
        <p>
          You have been asked to design a software system for a well-known
          online store. The system will allow customers to search for products
          sold at the website and add them to their shopping basket - at this
          stage an order is in progress. Products are sold both by the website
          itself and several third-party sellers as part of the website’s
          marketplace. Third-party sellers can be individuals or organisations,
          and once they have registered as a seller, they maintain their own
          product catalogue, pricing and storefront. If a product is temporarily
          out of stock, then then it will be marked as unavailable.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once a customer has finished their shopping, the order is considered
          to be processing and they are taken through the checkout process,
          where they will specify delivery details. Customers have the choice of
          several delivery options, including standard delivery using the postal
          service and the company’s own in-house courier service. Products
          ordered from third-party sellers at the marketplace do not have access
          to the in-house courier system. When the delivery options have been
          chosen, then the customer is presented with the payment options, where
          they can opt to use a credit or debit card, an online payment service
          (e.g., PayPal) or a gift voucher. Additionally, customers may also use
          promotional codes that are periodically issued by the website.
          Customers have the option to store their payment details and so can
          simply use stored details for each purchase. At this stage, the order
          is pending payment, but once the customer submits their payment
          information, the validity of the account used (whether it is PayPal, a
          credit/debit card or gift voucher) will be verified by the appropriate
          service. Upon successful completion, the order is awaiting picking.
        </p>
        <p>
          When a customer completes a transaction, the order is passed to the
          warehouse staff. The warehouse staff will be required to look up the
          items on the stock database to determine the location of the item in
          the warehouse. Once the items are successfully collected and packaged,
          the order will be considered ready for delivery and distributed to the
          appropriate delivery company, depending on the customer’s preferences.
          When a member of the warehouse staff picks an item, to fulfil a
          customer order, the item is scanned with a handheld terminal to
          automatically update the stock levels (which will be reflected on the
          website). Finally, the order is collected by the appropriate delivery
          company and marked as shipped.
        </p>
        <p>Using the scenario provided, you should design and develop:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>A class diagram.</li>
          <li>
            An activity diagram for the process of a customer completing an
            order.
          </li>
          <li>
            A state diagram highlighting the states of an order (and their
            transitions) for your proposed system.

          For this assignment you needed to use the scenario provided to design
          and develop a class diagram, an activity diagram for the process of a

          You needed to draw out the objects, attributes, operations and
          relationships of the system in a rationale for your analysis (500
          words). Please see below some general feedback which I hope you find
          useful.&nbsp;&nbsp;

          enumeration which can also cover payment status/options such as
          unpaid, pending etc. In the activity diagram the workflows of the
