        <p>Very good stuff. Clear and accurate.</p>
        <h4>Alice Villar</h4>
        <p>Hi Anrich,</p>
        <p>
          Your syntax inside the classes (attributes and actions) looks perfect.
          You always start with lowercase letters and then indicate the data
          type. I could understand the content of every class.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, the relationships between the classes look confusing.
          Following Yohay, I used StarUML, which helped a lot because the arrow
          comes with the correspondent name (composition, aggregation,
          generalization, etc. ) I believe that once you use the UML arrows it
          will look more clear.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also think you missed the payment class, which I believe would help
          a lot to organize the flow. For instance, in my diagram, I created a
          relationship of composition between payment and loyalty schemes,
          meaning that customers with loyalty will have discounts in payments.
          When there is no composition, we have that awkward situation where we
          receive a discount but it is not automatically applied to the payment.
          It has happened to me. The design has to be clear so the programming
          does not lead to situations like this.
        </p>
        <p>Kind regards,</p>

        <h2>Seminar 3: Working with UML</h2>
        <p>
          In this week’s activity, you are going to get some hands-on practice
          with UML, with a scenario, which is described below. You have been
          asked to develop UML diagrams for a doctor’s surgery based on the
          following scenario:
        </p>
        <p>
          Before a patient can see a doctor, or nurse, they will be required to
          make an appointment. The appointment will be made by the receptionist.
          However, before making the appointment, the receptionist needs to ask
          the patient which doctor they would like to see, and whether the
          appointment is standard consultation or an emergency appointment. The
          receptionist will use this information to check the appointment
          schedule, find an available appointment and make the booking. During
          the appointment itself, the doctor may issue the patient with a
          prescription. It is possible for a patient to request a repeat
          prescription be raised. Receptionists are able to cancel appointments
          as well as create them. A doctor at the clinic may have a maximum of
          500 patients registered to them at any one time.
        </p>
        <p>You should create:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>A class diagram for the system.</li>
          <li>A sequence diagram for booking an appointment.</li>
          <li>
            An activity diagram for a receptionist booking an appointment.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Normalisation in practice</h2>

        <p>
          The aim of this activity is to allow you to gain some experience
          normalising a set of tables.
        </p>
        <p>
          Given the following set of tables, for our property lettings example,
          you should develop a table structure that conforms to third normal
          form (3NF). This will be discussed in next week’s seminar. Post your
          structure to the discussion below and compare your own approach with
          your peers. Use the guidelines provided for peer review on the
          department website.

        <h4>Alice Villar</h4>
        <p>Hi Anrich,</p>
        <p>I think your diagram is great!! Thank you for sharing.</p>
        <p>
          My only observation is about having 2 tables for owners and clients.
          Personally, I'd rather create a table for People than two tables for
          owner and client. After all the goal is to organize data to prevent
          redundancy.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another observation I have is that when I first saw your diagram I
          asked myself : "why didn't he create keys to his relationship tables
          ("issueJunction" and "propertyJunction")?". Then, when I created my
          own diagram I realized that for some reason it just doesn't show in
          the automatic diagram. In my code, I defined a composite key to those
          tables and created foreign keys. I think we did the same thing in the
          code:
        </p>
        <code>
          CREATE TABLE Property_Person ( Property_Id int not null, Person_Id int
          not null, primary key (Property_Id,Person_Id), foreign key
          (Property_Id) references Property (Property_Cod), foreign key
          (Person_Id) references Person (Person_Cod) );
        </code>
        <p>Kind regards,</p>
        <p>Alice</p>
