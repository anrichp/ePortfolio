        <h4>Quality of written expression & presentation (40%)</h4>
        <h5>PASS</h5>
        <p>
          Clearly understandable use of English, And a Good attempt at academic
          presentation. There is evidence of discussion of ideas and some
          development of critical analysis. It is unclear how including the
          titles of 14 areas in computing serves the purpose of this report, and
          perhaps simply pointing the reader to the reference would suffice.
          Please consider that every sentence needs to directly contribute to
          the question requirements.
        </p>
        <h4>Following instructions (30%)</h4>
        <h5>PASS</h5>
        <p>
          The assignment is completed within the required word count. There is
          an attempt to respond to the set questions. There is a very good
          discussion of the need and benefits of PG education, which links well
          with the degree offering pursuit by the author. However, there was no
          attempt to incorporate learning from the induction module to aid with
          explaining and articulating the discussions. In addition, discussion
          on career expectations and plans are also somehow lacking. There is a
          reasonable attempt at critical analysis of the need for the degree
          generally, but not quite from the authorâ€™s practice area which would
          have been a great addition. There is more than one entry on job
          advancement and career benefits.
        </p>
        <h4>Academic integrity and wider reading (30%)</h4>
        <h5>STRONG PASS</h5>
        <p>
          There are eight good references and the report makes good use of the
          Harvard style. The Turnitin score stands at 30% and part of it is the
          list of 14 computer science topics mentioned above (contributes to 5%
          of the score). The rest is mostly relevant to references.
